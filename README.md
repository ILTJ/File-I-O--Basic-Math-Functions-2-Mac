File-I-O--Basic-Math-Functions-2-Mac
====================================

This is a basic C++ program on Mac that uses file input (data.txt) and output (output.txt). 
This program calculates the number of integers (1 to 100) you have entered in the input file (data.txt) and 
displays the number of integers, the sum of the integers, the largest integer, the smallest integer, the 
average of the integers and finally the number of integers above the average.
